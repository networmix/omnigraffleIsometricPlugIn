// Access: PlugIn.find("com.networmix.OmniGraffleIsometricPlugin").library("IsometricLib")

== CONSTANTS ==

• COS_30       - cos(30°) ≈ 0.866
• SIN_30       - sin(30°) = 0.5

== FUNCTIONS ==

• makePlane(graphics, planeType)
    Transform graphics to isometric plane.
    Transforms each graphic individually using shared origin for proper undo support.
    Handles text rotation automatically.

    Parameters:
      - graphics: Array of graphics to transform
      - planeType: 'left', 'right', 'topLeft', or 'topRight'

    Transformation approach:
      - left/right: Scale X by cos(30°), then skew Y by ±30°
      - topLeft/topRight: Isometric projection matrix (no distortion)

    Text handling:
      - Rotated but not geometrically transformed (keeps text editable)
      - left/topLeft: +30°, right/topRight: -30°

    Notes:
      - Shapes are converted to Bezier for point manipulation
      - Lines are transformed via their points array
      - Groups are flattened; all leaf graphics share the same origin
